# Depth Boosted Splatting
A minimal, reproducible experiment showing how injecting a monocular depth prior into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) loss function improves reconstruction quality.
The research prototype aims to demonstrate a measurable gain in PSNR and visual sharpness by adding a single-frame depth supervision termâ€”ideal for thesis checkpoints, AR/VR reconstruction pipelines, and depth-aware rendering studies.
